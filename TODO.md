So this is really just a list to attempt to keep track of what I've been doing, what has been completed and what still needs to be done to make this all functional.

So far this branch is completely ignoring the actual content of the documentation, you will find the `pulsar-docs` folder filled with junk that I've been using for testing.

## Implemented

- Basic navbar layout
- Basic footer layout
- Main content layout

## To be added

- Media queries to make main layout & footer properly responsive
- Collapsible sidebar
- Collapsible chapters
- Active/selected style for books
- Active/selected style for section
- Navbar content
- Sort out a variables page
- Theming system (like packages site)
